    f'  - {{"type": "{PARAGRAPH}", "children": [ TEXT, ... ]}} — normal '
    "academic prose, one idea per paragraph.\n"
    f'  - {{"type": "{HEADING_2}", "children": [ TEXT ]}} — a subtopic '
    "heading, used sparingly and mostly inside 'body' for genuine subtopic "
    f"breaks. Never inside 'presentation' or 'index'. Deeper levels "
    f'("heading-3", "heading-4", "heading-5") exist for genuinely nested '
    "subtopics but are rarely needed — do not use them just to vary "
    "appearance.\n"
    f'  - {{"type": "{BLOCK_QUOTE}", "children": [ PARAGRAPH-like TEXT '
    "children ]}} — ONLY for a direct quotation of 40+ words per APA 7 "
    "(shorter quotes stay inline inside a normal paragraph, in quotation "
    "marks).\n"
    f'  - {{"type": "{BULLETED_LIST}", "children": [ LIST_ITEM, ... ]}} — '
    "use ONLY when items have no meaningful order (parallel examples, "
    "equivalent characteristics).\n"
    f'  - {{"type": "{NUMBERED_LIST}", "children": [ LIST_ITEM, ... ]}} — '
    "use when items are steps, a chronology, or a ranked hierarchy.\n"
    f'  A LIST_ITEM is {{"type": "{LIST_ITEM}", "children": [ TEXT, ... ]}}.\n'
    f'  - {{"type": "{TABLE}", "children": [ TABLE_ROW, ... ]}} — use ONLY '
    "for genuinely tabular data (rows of comparable fields/numbers). Do "
    "not use a table to lay out things that are really a list or plain "
    f'prose. A TABLE_ROW is {{"type": "{TABLE_ROW}", "children": [ '
    f'TABLE_CELL, ... ]}}. A TABLE_CELL is {{"type": "{TABLE_CELL}", '
    '"children": [ PARAGRAPH, ... ]}} — a cell\'s children are block '
    "nodes (usually a single 'paragraph'), never bare text nodes. Every "
    "row in a table must have the same number of cells, and the first "
    "row is normally the header row (its cells' paragraph text in bold).\n"
    '  A TEXT node is a leaf: {"text": "..."} or, when a mark is genuinely '
    'useful, {"text": "...", "marks": [ MARK, ... ]}. Each MARK is an '
    'object {"type": "bold"} or {"type": "color", "value": "#d93025"}. '
    "Valid mark types: 'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strikethrough' (no "
    'value needed); \'script\' (value: "superscript" or "subscript"); '
    "'color' / 'highlight' (value: a hex color string); 'link' (value: "
    '{"url": "..."}) — only when the source material names a URL to '
    "cite inline. Use marks sparingly, never on whole sentences, never "
    "invented decoration.\n"
    "  EVERY block node ('paragraph', 'heading-N', 'block-quote', "
    "'bulleted-list', 'numbered-list', 'list-item') MUST include a "
    "'styles' object with 'textAlign' set explicitly — never omit it, "
    "never leave it to be inferred. Use APA 7's own convention per type: "
    "'paragraph' and 'block-quote' -> \"justify\"; 'heading-1' -> "
    "\"center\"; 'heading-2' through 'heading-5' -> \"left\"; "
    "'list-item' -> \"left\". Only deviate from these defaults if the "
    "user's additional notes explicitly ask for different alignment on "
    "specific content. Besides 'textAlign', 'styles' may also carry "
    "textIndent, marginTop/Bottom/Left/Right, lineHeight, "
    "backgroundColor, borderLeft, etc. — but add those ONLY when the "
    "user's additional notes explicitly ask for that particular visual "
    "formatting.\n"
    f'  A standalone {{"type": "{PAGE_BREAK}"}} node forces a new page at '
    "that point, and never has 'children' or 'styles'. The exporter "
    "renders EXACTLY the tree you return — it never invents page breaks "
    "of its own — so the ones APA 7 always requires must be present in "
    "your JSON:\n"
    f'    - The \'presentation\' section\'s \'nodes\' MUST end with a '
    f'{{"type": "{PAGE_BREAK}"}} node (the cover page always starts the '
    "table of contents on a fresh page).\n"
    f'    - The \'conclusion\' section\'s \'nodes\' MUST end with a '
    f'{{"type": "{PAGE_BREAK}"}} node (the body always starts the '
    "references on a fresh page).\n"
    "    - Do NOT add a page-break node anywhere else — not between "
    "'introduction' and 'body', not between subtopics ('heading-2' "
    "already separates those visually), and not as decoration — unless "
    "the user's additional notes explicitly ask for one extra, specific "
    "pagination break somewhere in the body.\n"
    "    - (The 'index' section's own trailing page break is added by "
    "the application, since you never write that section — see the "
    "'index' rule below.)\n"
    '  NEVER output a node with "type": "image". You have no way to '
    "produce a real, working file URL, so an invented 'src' would be a "
    "broken link — images are inserted by the application separately, "
    "after your text is generated.\n"
    f'  NEVER output a node with "type": "{TABLE_OF_CONTENTS}". That node '
    "is built entirely by the application from your real headings — see "
    "the 'index' rule below.\n"
    "  NEVER type a page number into paragraph text anywhere in the "
    'document (no "Página 1", no "[page X]", no manual folio). The '
    "application draws real page numbers itself from "
    "'document_styles.showPageNumbers' / 'pageNumberPosition'.\n"
    "Rules that still apply regardless of node type:\n"
    "- Lists are the exception, not the default: most content must be "
    "'paragraph' nodes. Every item in a list must be grammatically "
    "parallel with the others (all full sentences, or all short "
    "fragments — not mixed).\n"
    "- Keep paragraphs short and centered on a single idea; never merge "
    "several distinct ideas into one 'paragraph' node — split them into "
    "separate paragraph nodes instead.\n"
    "- Titles (document title and every section title) must be short, "
    "original, in your own words, in the source's language, NEVER a URL, "
    "NEVER copied verbatim from source text, at most ~12 words."

    "8. The 'presentation' section is REQUIRED and must exist, but it is "
    "NOT a summary or abstract of the document's topic. Its 'nodes' must "
    "restate ONLY the structured presentation data given to you below — "
    "student name, institution, subject/course, professor, student ID (if "
    "provided), and today's date — as separate 'paragraph' nodes (one "

    '{"type": "page-break"} node — see the page-break rule above.\n'

    "completely from your JSON response. The application builds the "
    "table of contents itself, after you respond, from the real "
    "'heading-1' and 'heading-2' nodes you wrote in the other sections — "
    "it is not something you write or narrate. Your required sections "
    "are therefore exactly these five, in order: presentation, "
    "introduction, body, conclusion, sources.\n"
    "10. If the user's additional notes explicitly request custom "
    "visual formatting (a specific color, alignment, emphasis, a "
    "highlighted term, a quote box, etc.), honor it using 'styles' on the "
    "relevant block node(s) and/or 'marks' on the relevant text — but "
    "only for what was actually requested, nothing more.\n"

    "updated 'title' and 'nodes' for that section.\n"

    "regenerate 'conclusion', its LAST node must still be a "
    '{"type": "page-break"} node, exactly as before. '

    "12. Preserve any existing 'styles' or 'marks' you see on nodes you "
    "keep or lightly edit — don't strip formatting the user (or a previous "
    "request) explicitly asked for. Only add new 'styles'/'marks' if the "
    "current additional notes explicitly request them, and never invent "
